# Proa Tools Forms

Management of Bootstrap forms.

## Installation

```bash
bower install proa-tools-forms
```

## Usage

There are one functionality (AngularJS directive) and one CSS design (class name built into Bootstrap 3):

### Automatic labelling

Labelable elements are automatically associated. It is not necessary any extra adding. So, keep Bootstrap's tags as normally without related attributes (`label`s' `for` and controls' ID).

### Flex forms

Add `.form-flex` to your form for left-aligned form groups.
