# Proa Tools Forms

Management of Bootstrap forms.

## Install

```
bower install proa-tools-forms
```

## Use

For now, there is only one funcionality: forms `label`s are automatically relates (throught the `for` attribute) with its `input`. It is not necessary an extra adding. So, keep Bootstrap tags as normally.
